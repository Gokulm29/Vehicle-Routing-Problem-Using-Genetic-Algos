**Vehicle Routing**

This project provides a solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using optimization and routing techniques, designed for logistics and transportation efficiency. The implementation is in a Jupyter Notebook, optimized for use on Google Colab.




**Features**

**Optimization Algorithms**: Implements methods to minimize costs and maximize route efficiency.

**Data Analysis**: Processes input data to support decision-making.

**Visualization**: Plots routes and results for better understanding.




**Requirements**

Google Colab (No local installation needed)
Required Libraries: Automatically installed via notebook setup.


**Usage**

Upload the notebook to Google Colab.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook.

Upload any required input data (e.g., CSV or JSON files) to the Colab environment.

Run all cells to execute the VRP solution and view the results.


**Data**

Ensure your input files are formatted correctly and uploaded to the Colab environment before running the notebook.



**Contributions**

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for improvements.
